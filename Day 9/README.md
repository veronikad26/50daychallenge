# ðŸ’» Day 9 - LeetCode Practice

## ðŸ”¹ Q1: Swapping Nodes in Linked List  
*Problem:* Given a linked list, swap the k-th node from the beginning with the k-th node from the end. Return the modified list.  
*Leetcode Link:* [Swapping Nodes in Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/swapping-nodes-in-a-linked-list)

### âœ… Approach:
- Traverse the list and use two pointers: one to find the k-th node from the beginning (`p`), and the other to find the k-th node from the end (`q`).
- Swap the values of the two nodes.
- Time Complexity: **O(n)**, Space Complexity: **O(1)**.
