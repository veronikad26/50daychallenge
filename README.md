# ðŸš€ 50 Days Coding Challenge 

Welcome to the **50 Days Coding Challenge**,  a focused and structured initiative under the inspiring **#DrGViswanathanChallenge**. This challenge is built to promote consistency, improve coding logic, and strengthen problem-solving skills through daily practice.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal is to instill consistency, enhance logical thinking, and boost coding proficiency through daily practice in two key areas:
- **Data Structures Algorithms **
- **Mathematics-based programming**

## ðŸ§  Challenge Format

- **Duration**: 50 Consecutive Days  
- **Daily Tasks**:
  - ðŸ”¹ 1 Problem from **DSA** 
  - ðŸ”¹ 1 **Math-based** programming problem
- **Time Limit**: 24 hours to complete both problems
- **Problem Sharing**: New problems are shared daily


## ðŸ“ˆ Outcomes

By the end of this challenge, participants will:
- Improve coding logic and speed
- Strengthen core Data Structures & Algorithms concepts
- Build a habit of consistent problem-solving
- Be better prepared for technical interviews and coding assessments

This challenge is a collaboration between **VIT Bhopal** and **FACE Prep**.  
Looking forward to an exciting journey of consistency, learning, and growth together! ðŸš€
